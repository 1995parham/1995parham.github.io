When our university started to create IoT platform, we did some research and decided
to use Kaa as our middleware. In this article we want to compare Kaa and ThingSpeak.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4>Kaa</h4>
<p>
Kaa is multi-purpose middleware platform for building complete end-to-end IoT solutions. Kaa has 3
layer architecture as below:

Kaa provides some basic services for you such as <strong>Notifications</strong>,
<strong>Logging</strong> and <strong>Events</strong>.
In Kaa you have to install SDK on your nodes in order to join them to your network, as a result
your node choices decrease, but you have more control on your nodes.
</p>
<p>
One the most important features of Kaa is it's log collector, with it's log collector
you can store your log in NoSQL databases like MongoDB, you can analyze your data with
many data processors like hadoop and at the end you can provide your log collector to kaa
with simple REST URL callbacking.
