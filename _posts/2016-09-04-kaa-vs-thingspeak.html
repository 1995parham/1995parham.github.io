When our university started to create IoT platform, we did some research and decided
to use Kaa as our middleware. In this article we want to compare Kaa and ThingSpeak.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4><a href="http://www.kaaproject.org/">Kaa</a></h4>
<p>
Kaa is multi-purpose middleware platform for building complete end-to-end IoT solutions. Kaa has 3
layer architecture as below:

<p>
Kaa provides some basic services for you such as <strong>Notifications</strong>,
<strong>Logging</strong> and <strong>Events</strong>.
In Kaa you have to install SDK on your nodes in order to join them to your network, as a result
your node choices decrease, but you have more control on your nodes.
</p>
<p>
One the most important features of Kaa is it's log collector, with it's log collector
you can store your log in NoSQL databases like MongoDB, you can analyze your data with
many data processors like hadoop and at the end you can provide your log collector to kaa
with simple REST URL callbacking.
</p>
<p>
Kaa provides in distributed manner and you can build your Kaa based environment on a
two or more server for load distribution.
</p>
<h4><a href="http://thingspeak.com/">ThingSpeak</a></h4>
<p>
ThingSpeak provides <strong>Real-time data collection and storage</strong>. You can
easily create channel for your data in this platform and send your data to it using
simple and available REST protocol !
</p>
<p>
Generally speaking ThingSpeak is less complicated than Kaa but in some point of views
it's a good thing because you can up and running it in few steps. ThingSpeak do not have
any SDK or package requirements in your nodes, so you can use whatever you want util they
can create REST request for ThingSpeak
</p>
<p>
ThingSpeak indeed provides 2 layer architecture for your IoT platform, in this architecture
ThingSpeak just collects and stores your data and you can do some Matlab based analysis on it.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Personally I think Kaa can be used in a local environment when you have your own cloud and servers, with
Kaa you can always have your data in your place and provide management on your devices based on your
applications. It's good to remind that Kaa provides many way for creating management and other type
applications from REST to SDK !
</p>
<p>
With ThingSpeak you don't need even a PC but it restrict you to Matlab for data analysis and you
can't provide controller application for your nodes with this platform.
