			<div class="interests-tooltip">
				<p>
					Software-defined networking (SDN) is an approach to computer networking that
					allows network administrators to manage network services through abstraction
					of higher-level functionality. This is done by decoupling the system that makes
					decisions about where traffic is sent (the control plane) from the underlying systems
					that forward traffic to the selected destination (the data plane).

				<p>
					In computer science, network function virtualization (NFV) is a network architecture
					concept that uses the technologies of IT virtualization to virtualize entire classes
