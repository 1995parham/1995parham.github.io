		<div class="interests-tooltip">
			<p>
				Software-defined networking (SDN) is an approach to computer networking that
				allows network administrators to manage network services through abstraction
				of higher-level functionality. This is done by decoupling the system that makes
				decisions about where traffic is sent (the control plane) from the underlying systems
				that forward traffic to the selected destination (the data plane).
